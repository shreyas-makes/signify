# Step 9: Keystroke Timeline Visualization

## Overview
Create visual representation of the keystroke timeline showing typing progression and patterns.

## Requirements
- Build keystroke timeline component showing typing progression
- Display timestamp markers for writing sessions
- Visualize pauses and typing speed variations
- Add interactive elements to explore different sections
- Show total typing time and session breaks
- Create git-style commit graph visualization
- Handle large datasets efficiently
- Add responsive design for mobile viewing

## Technical Specifications
- Render timeline using SVG or Canvas for performance
- Group keystrokes into time buckets (30-second intervals)
- Calculate typing speed and pause patterns
- Use color coding for different typing intensities
- Add hover effects to show detailed timing
- Implement virtualization for large datasets
- Ensure smooth animations and interactions

## Implementation Prompt

```
Create an interactive keystroke timeline visualization that shows the typing process and patterns.

Requirements:
1. Timeline visualization component:
   - Git-style commit graph showing typing progression
   - Time-based horizontal axis with clear markers
   - Vertical indicators for typing activity
   - Color coding for typing intensity (light to dark)
   - Visual representation of pauses and breaks

2. Data processing:
   - Group keystrokes into 30-second time buckets
   - Calculate typing metrics per bucket:
     - Characters per minute
     - Keystrokes per minute
     - Pause frequency
     - Error correction rate (backspaces)
   - Identify natural writing sessions vs breaks

3. Interactive features:
   - Hover effects showing detailed statistics
   - Clickable timeline sections
   - Zoom functionality for detailed inspection
   - Tooltip with timing information
   - Smooth transitions and animations

4. Timeline display:
   - Visual style similar to GitHub commit graphs
   - Time markers: start time, major breaks, end time
   - Activity indicators: dots, bars, or gradient fills
   - Color scale from light (low activity) to dark (high activity)
   - Clean, professional appearance

5. Statistics panel:
   - Total typing time (excluding long pauses)
   - Average typing speed (WPM)
   - Number of writing sessions
   - Longest continuous typing session
   - Total keystrokes and characters
   - Error correction frequency

6. Mobile optimization:
   - Touch-friendly interface
   - Responsive timeline scaling
   - Simplified view for small screens
   - Gesture support for navigation
   - Readable text and indicators

7. Performance optimization:
   - Efficient rendering for large datasets
   - Virtualization for timelines with many points
   - Debounced hover effects
   - Optimized SVG/Canvas rendering
   - Smooth scrolling and zooming

8. Accessibility:
   - Screen reader compatible descriptions
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - High contrast color schemes
   - Alternative text representations
   - Focus management

9. Data visualization:
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Intuitive color coding
   - Proper spacing and margins
   - Legend for understanding metrics
   - Visual consistency with app design

10. Export functionality:
    - Download timeline as image (PNG/SVG)
    - Export statistics as JSON/CSV
    - Share specific timeline sections
    - Print-friendly version
    - Embed code for external sites

Create an engaging, informative timeline that makes keystroke patterns easily understandable and verifiable.
```
