# Step 5: Paste Prevention & Security

## Overview
Implement complete paste prevention and input security to ensure all content is manually typed.

## Requirements
- Block all paste operations (Ctrl+V, right-click paste, drag-and-drop)
- Display helpful error messages when paste is attempted
- Prevent programmatic content insertion
- Block drag-and-drop of text or files
- Handle middle-click paste on Linux/Unix systems
- Add visual feedback when paste is blocked
- Allow only keyboard input for content creation
- Test across different browsers and operating systems

## Technical Specifications
- Prevent paste event with preventDefault()
- Block contextmenu for right-click paste prevention
- Intercept drag-and-drop events
- Handle beforeinput events for programmatic prevention
- Show toast notification: "Paste blocked - All content must be manually typed"
- Maintain list of blocked input methods for logging
- Ensure accessibility isn't compromised

## Implementation Prompt

```
Implement comprehensive paste prevention and input security for the Signify editor to ensure all content is manually typed.

Requirements:
1. Paste prevention system:
   - Block Ctrl+V / Cmd+V paste operations
   - Block right-click context menu paste
   - Block middle-click paste (Linux/Unix)
   - Prevent drag-and-drop of text and files
   - Block programmatic content insertion via JavaScript

2. Event handling:
   - preventDefault() on paste events
   - Block beforeinput events for pasted content
   - Disable contextmenu for right-click prevention
   - Handle dragover, dragenter, drop events
   - Monitor input events for suspicious bulk insertions

3. User feedback system:
   - Toast notifications for blocked paste attempts
   - Clear, helpful error messages
   - Visual feedback without disrupting typing flow
   - Count and log paste attempts for analytics

4. Toast notification component:
   - Non-intrusive design (top-right corner)
   - Auto-dismiss after 3 seconds
   - Multiple notification handling
   - Accessibility support with ARIA live regions
   - Smooth animations (fade in/out)

5. Security measures:
   - Detect and block rapid text insertion
   - Monitor for unusual typing patterns
   - Log security events for analysis
   - Prevent clipboard API access
   - Block browser autofill for content areas

6. Cross-browser compatibility:
   - Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
   - Handle browser-specific paste behaviors
   - Account for mobile browser differences
   - Ensure accessibility tools still work

7. Error messages:
   - "Paste blocked - All content must be manually typed"
   - "Drag and drop disabled - Please type manually"
   - "Bulk text insertion prevented - Type character by character"
   - Contextual help explaining why paste is blocked

8. Accessibility considerations:
   - Don't interfere with screen readers
   - Allow assistive technology input
   - Maintain keyboard navigation
   - Provide alternative text input methods if needed

9. Integration requirements:
   - Seamless integration with keystroke capture
   - No interference with legitimate typing
   - Proper cleanup of event listeners
   - Performance monitoring for security checks

Create a robust security system that prevents all forms of paste while maintaining excellent user experience and accessibility.
```

## Deliverables
- Complete paste prevention system
- User-friendly error messages
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Toast notification system
- Security testing for all paste methods
