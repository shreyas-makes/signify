# Step 10: Raw Keystroke Data Access

## Overview
Implement public access to raw keystroke data for transparency and verification.

## Requirements
- Create API endpoint for raw keystroke data with timestamps
- Build UI component to display keystroke events in readable format
- Add search and filter functionality for keystroke exploration
- Implement pagination for large keystroke datasets
- Show detailed timing information for each keystroke
- Add download functionality for keystroke data (JSON/CSV)
- Include data verification tools
- Handle privacy considerations appropriately

## Technical Specifications
- GET /posts/:slug/keystrokes endpoint with pagination
- Return keystroke data in chronological order
- Include timing gaps and pause detection
- Format timestamps in human-readable format
- Implement efficient pagination (50 events per page)
- Add export functionality in multiple formats
- Calculate and display typing statistics

## Implementation Prompt

```
Create a comprehensive raw keystroke data access system for transparency and verification.

Requirements:
1. Backend API endpoint:
   - GET /posts/:slug/keystrokes
   - Pagination: ?page=1&limit=50
   - Filtering: ?eventType=input&timeRange=start-end
   - Return: { keystrokes: [], totalCount, page, hasMore }
   - Include timing calculations and gaps
   - Efficient database queries with indexes

2. Keystroke data viewer:
   - Table view with columns: timestamp, character, event type, timing gap
   - Infinite scroll or pagination controls
   - Search functionality by character or event type
   - Filter by time ranges and event types
   - Sortable columns
   - Export functionality (JSON, CSV, TXT)

3. Data formatting:
   - Human-readable timestamps (relative and absolute)
   - Visual indicators for special characters
   - Color coding for event types
   - Timing gap calculations between keystrokes
   - Clear display of deletions and corrections

4. Search and filtering:
   - Full-text search through keystroke data
   - Filter by event type (input, delete, backspace)
   - Time range filtering with date/time pickers
   - Character type filtering (letters, numbers, special)
   - Advanced query builder interface

5. Statistics and analysis:
   - Typing speed over time graph
   - Pause pattern analysis
   - Error correction frequency
   - Character frequency distribution
   - Typing session breakdown
   - Detailed timing statistics

6. Export functionality:
   - JSON export with full data structure
   - CSV export for spreadsheet analysis
   - Text format for simple viewing
   - Filtered export (only selected data)
   - Large dataset handling with streaming

7. Verification tools:
   - Data integrity verification
   - Keystroke sequence validation
   - Timeline consistency checks
   - Character matching with final content
   - Anomaly detection reporting

8. Privacy considerations:
   - No personal information in keystroke data
   - Anonymized timing patterns
   - Clear data policy display
   - User control over data visibility
   - GDPR compliance measures

9. Performance optimization:
   - Lazy loading for large datasets
   - Virtual scrolling for performance
   - Debounced search and filtering
   - Cached query results
   - Efficient data structures

10. User experience:
    - Clear data presentation
    - Intuitive navigation
    - Helpful tooltips and explanations
    - Mobile-friendly interface
    - Quick access to summary statistics

Create a powerful yet user-friendly system for exploring and verifying keystroke authenticity.

## Deliverables
- Raw keystroke data API endpoint
- Keystroke viewer UI component
- Search and filter functionality
- Pagination for large datasets
- Data export capabilities (JSON/CSV)
- Detailed timing information display
- Privacy-conscious data presentation
