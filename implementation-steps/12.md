# Step 12: Error Handling & Edge Cases

## Overview
Implement comprehensive error handling, edge case management, and user experience improvements.

## Requirements
- Add global error boundary for React application
- Implement retry logic for failed API requests
- Handle network connectivity issues gracefully
- Add loading states for all async operations
- Create user-friendly error messages
- Handle browser compatibility issues
- Add input validation and sanitization
- Implement rate limiting protection

## Technical Specifications
- Global error boundary with error reporting
- Exponential backoff for API retries
- Offline detection and user notification
- Loading spinners and skeleton screens
- Form validation with real-time feedback
- XSS protection and input sanitization
- Rate limiting with user feedback
- Browser feature detection and fallbacks

## Implementation Prompt

```
Implement comprehensive error handling and edge case management to create a robust, production-ready application.

Requirements:
1. Global error handling:
   - React error boundary for component crashes
   - Global window error handler for unhandled exceptions
   - Promise rejection handling
   - Network error detection and recovery
   - Error logging and reporting system

2. API error handling:
   - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
   - Network timeout handling (30 second timeout)
   - Rate limiting detection and user feedback
   - Server error response handling (4xx, 5xx)
   - Graceful degradation for API failures

3. User feedback system:
   - Toast notifications for errors and success
   - Loading states for all async operations
   - Skeleton screens for content loading
   - Progress indicators for long operations
   - Clear error messages with suggested actions

4. Network connectivity:
   - Online/offline detection
   - Queue actions when offline
   - Auto-retry when connection restored
   - Offline indicator in UI
   - Data sync when back online

5. Input validation and security:
   - Real-time form validation
   - Server-side validation for all inputs
   - XSS protection and input sanitization
   - SQL injection prevention
   - File upload validation (if applicable)

6. Browser compatibility:
   - Feature detection for modern APIs
   - Polyfills for missing functionality
   - Graceful degradation for older browsers
   - Mobile browser specific handling
   - Cross-browser testing coverage

7. Edge cases handling:
   - Very large documents (>10k words)
   - Extremely long typing sessions (>4 hours)
   - Rapid typing (>200 WPM)
   - Special characters and Unicode
   - Empty or minimal content scenarios

8. Rate limiting protection:
   - Client-side rate limiting
   - Server-side protection with clear messages
   - Progressive delays for repeated attempts
   - User education about limits
   - Premium tier handling

9. Data consistency:
   - Keystroke data integrity validation
   - Content-keystroke matching verification
   - Database transaction failure handling
   - Partial save recovery
   - Conflict resolution strategies

10. Performance monitoring:
    - Error rate tracking
    - Performance metrics collection
    - User experience monitoring
    - Alert systems for critical errors
    - Dashboard for error analysis

11. User experience improvements:
    - Contextual help and tooltips
    - Onboarding flow for new users
    - Keyboard shortcuts documentation
    - Accessibility improvements
    - Mobile user experience optimization

12. Security hardening:
    - CSRF protection
    - Content Security Policy headers
    - Secure cookie configuration
    - Input length limits
    - Request rate monitoring

Create a robust, user-friendly application that handles errors gracefully and provides excellent user experience even when things go wrong.
