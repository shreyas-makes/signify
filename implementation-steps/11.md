# Step 11: Character-by-Character Replay

## Overview
Build interactive replay system that shows the typing process character by character.

## Requirements
- Create replay component that reconstructs the typing process
- Add playback controls (play, pause, speed adjustment)
- Show cursor position and text changes in real-time
- Display timing information during replay
- Handle backspaces and deletions in replay
- Add progress bar for replay navigation
- Implement different playback speeds (0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x)
- Show typing statistics during replay

## Technical Specifications
- Process keystroke events chronologically
- Handle text insertion, deletion, and cursor movement
- Implement smooth animations between keystrokes
- Calculate realistic timing for playback
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth rendering
- Handle edge cases like rapid typing and corrections
- Optimize performance for long typing sessions

## Implementation Prompt

```
Create an interactive character-by-character replay system that reconstructs the original typing process.

Requirements:
1. Replay engine:
   - Process keystroke events in chronological order
   - Reconstruct text state at each keystroke
   - Handle insertions, deletions, and cursor movements
   - Maintain accurate character positioning
   - Support forward and backward playback

2. Playback controls:
   - Play/Pause button with keyboard shortcuts (spacebar)
   - Speed controls: 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x speed
   - Progress bar with scrubbing capability
   - Step forward/backward buttons (arrow keys)
   - Jump to beginning/end functionality

3. Visual replay display:
   - Text editor showing live typing reconstruction
   - Animated cursor movement
   - Real-time character appearance/deletion
   - Smooth transitions between states
   - Highlighting of current character being typed

4. Timing and statistics:
   - Real-time WPM calculation during replay
   - Current time position and total duration
   - Pause detection and visualization
   - Keystroke counter and position
   - Session progress indicator

5. Advanced features:
   - Zoom functionality for detailed inspection
   - Bookmark interesting moments in replay
   - Skip long pauses automatically
   - Highlight errors and corrections
   - Side-by-side comparison with final text

6. Performance optimization:
   - Efficient state reconstruction algorithms
   - Smooth 60fps animation using requestAnimationFrame
   - Memory optimization for long sessions
   - Lazy loading of keystroke data
   - Pause animation during inactivity

7. User interface:
   - Intuitive control panel
   - Keyboard shortcuts for all functions
   - Visual feedback for user actions
   - Clear timing and progress information
   - Responsive design for mobile viewing

8. Accessibility:
   - Screen reader announcements for replay events
   - Keyboard-only navigation support
   - High contrast mode support
   - Audio cues for important events
   - Alternative text descriptions

9. Edge case handling:
   - Rapid typing sequences
   - Complex text editing (cut/paste attempts)
   - Unicode characters and emojis
   - Very long typing sessions
   - Corrupted or incomplete keystroke data

10. Export and sharing:
    - Generate GIF animations of replay segments
    - Share specific moments in replay
    - Export typing statistics from replay
    - Embed replay widget for external sites
    - Download replay data for analysis

Create an engaging, accurate replay system that demonstrates the authenticity of human typing patterns.
```

## Deliverables
- Character-by-character replay component
- Playback controls with speed adjustment
- Real-time cursor and text animation
- Progress bar for navigation
- Typing statistics during replay
- Smooth performance for long sessions
- Edge case handling for complex edits
